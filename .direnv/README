Virtual environments should be created in 
  ~/local/virutalenv
since they will be tied to a particular installation.

Virtual python environments created by:
virtualenv -p /usr/bin/python2.7 py27
virtualenv -p /usr/bin/python3.4 py34
virtualenv -p /usr/bin/python3.5 py35

Individually activate by:
  source py27/bin/activate

Directory contains different *direnv* environments.
Symlink them to a directory to activate an environment.

Example:
  cd MiniZinc
  ln -s ~/.direnv/MiniZinc .envrc
